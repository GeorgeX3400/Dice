        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Dice date back about as long as human civilization does, 
            with the earliest dice found in Egyptian tombs and archeological 
            digs in ancient Sumeria.

                <h4>Ancient Mesopotamia (3000 BCE):</h4>
                <p>Archaeological excavations have uncovered dice-like objects made from various materials, 
                including bone, ivory, and clay. 
                These artifacts suggest that dice were used for gaming and divination purposes in the early 
                Mesopotamian civilizations, such as Sumer and Akkad.

                <h4>Ancient Egypt (2600 BCE):</h4>
                <p>
                    Dice made from materials like bone, wood, 
                    and precious metals have been found in 
                    Egyptian tombs, indicating their association 
                    with funerary practices and the afterlife. 
                    These dice often featured markings or symbols, 
                    suggesting their use in both gaming and religious rituals.

                <p>
                    Although direct evidence is scarce, some scholars 
                    suggest that dice may have been used in the 
                    ancient cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, 
                    based on similarities with other contemporary cultures 
                    in the region. However, conclusive archaeological 
                    findings are yet to confirm this hypothesis.

                <h4>Ancient Greece (5th century BCE):</h4>
                <p>
                    Greek literature and artwork from this period depict dice 
                    as integral components of various games and 
                    recreational activities. Athenian pottery 
                    often features scenes of men engaged in 
                    dice games, reflecting the popularity of 
                    gaming in ancient Greek society.

                <p>
                    Dice games, such as "Tesserae" and "Tali," were 
                    immensely popular among Romans of all social classes. 
                    Dice made from bone, ivory, or bronze 
                    have been discovered in archaeological 
                    contexts across the former territories of 
                    the Roman Empire, providing insight into the 
                    gaming culture of ancient Rome.

                <h4>Medieval Europe(10th - 15th century BCE):</h4>
                <p>
                    Although the Christian Church occasionally denounced gambling, 
                    dice games remained prevalent among medieval Europeans. 
                    Dice made from bone or ivory were commonly used for both 
                    gambling and entertainment, with various regional 
                    variations of popular dice games emerging 
                    during this period.
